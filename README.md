- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sarahvl. I am completely new in bio-informatics. A consultant wrote a pipeline for us, but as he is not working here anymore, I try to learn to work with the pipeline myself in order to keep it updated,... And I also want to learn to write a pipeline myself for future project in our microbial diagnostics hospital lab.
- 👀 I’m interested in analyzing NGS data in microbiology
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to work in Linux, to use a pipeline which has been developed by a consultant to analyze the sars-cov2 genomes
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on microbioal diagnostics
- 📫 How to reach me: sarah.vanlent@zna.be
